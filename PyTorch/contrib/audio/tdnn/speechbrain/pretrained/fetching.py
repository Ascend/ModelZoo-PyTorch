    """Ensures you have a local copy of the file, returns its path

    In case the source is an external location, downloads the file.  In case
    the source is already accessible on the filesystem, creates a symlink in
    the savedir. Thus, the side effects of this function always look similar:
    savedir/save_filename can be used to access the file. And save_filename
    defaults to the filename arg.

    Arguments
    ---------
    filename : str
        Name of the file including extensions.
    source : str
        Where to look for the file. This is interpreted in special ways:
        First, if the source begins with "http://" or "https://", it is
        interpreted as a web address and the file is downloaded.
        Second, if the source is a valid directory path, a symlink is
        created to the file.
        Otherwise, the source is interpreted as a Huggingface model hub ID, and
        the file is downloaded from there.
    savedir : str
        Path where to save downloads/symlinks.
    overwrite : bool
        If True, always overwrite existing savedir/filename file and download
        or recreate the link. If False (as by default), if savedir/filename
        exists, assume it is correct and don't download/relink. Note that
        Huggingface local cache is always used - with overwrite=True we just
        relink from the local cache.
    save_filename : str
        The filename to use for saving this file. Defaults to filename if not
        given.
    use_auth_token : bool (default: False)
        If true Hugginface's auth_token will be used to load private models from the HuggingFace Hub,
        default is False because majority of models are public.
    Returns
    -------
    pathlib.Path
        Path to file on local file system.
