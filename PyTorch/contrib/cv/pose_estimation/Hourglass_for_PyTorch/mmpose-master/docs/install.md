## Installation

### Requirements

- Linux (Windows is not officially supported)
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.3+
- CUDA 9.2+ (If you build PyTorch from source, CUDA 9.0 is also compatible)
- GCC 5+
- [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) (Please install the latest version)
- Numpy
- cv2
- json_tricks
- [xtcocotools](https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi)

Optional:
- [mmdet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) (to run demos)


### Install mmpose

a. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 -y
conda activate open-mmlab
```

b. Install PyTorch and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/), e.g.,

```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

Note: Make sure that your compilation CUDA version and runtime CUDA version match.
You can check the supported CUDA version for precompiled packages on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/).

`E.g.1` If you have CUDA 10.1 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install PyTorch 1.5,
you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 10.1.

```shell
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch
```

`E.g.2` If you have CUDA 9.2 installed under `/usr/local/cuda` and would like to install PyTorch 1.3.1.,
you need to install the prebuilt PyTorch with CUDA 9.2.

```shell
conda install pytorch=1.3.1 cudatoolkit=9.2 torchvision=0.4.2 -c pytorch
```

If you build PyTorch from source instead of installing the prebuilt package, you can use more CUDA versions such as 9.0.

c. Clone the mmpose repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:open-mmlab/mmpose.git
cd mmpose
```


d. Install build requirements and then install mmpose

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

Note:

1. The git commit id will be written to the version number with step d, e.g. 0.6.0+2e7045c. The version will also be saved in trained models.
It is recommended that you run step d each time you pull some updates from github. If C++/CUDA codes are modified, then this step is compulsory.

2. Following the above instructions, mmpose is installed on `dev` mode, any local modifications made to the code will take effect without the need to reinstall it (unless you submit some commits and want to update the version number).

3. If you would like to use `opencv-python-headless` instead of `opencv-python`,
you can install it before installing MMCV.

### A from-scratch setup script

Here is a full script for setting up mmpose with conda and link the dataset path (supposing that your COCO dataset path is $COCO_ROOT).

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 -y
conda activate open-mmlab

conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision -y
git clone git@github.com:open-mmlab/mmpose.git
cd mmpose
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop

```

### Docker Image

We provide a [Dockerfile](/docker/Dockerfile) to build an image.

```shell
# build an image with PyTorch 1.6.0, CUDA 10.1, CUDNN 7.
docker build -f ./docker/Dockerfile --rm -t mmpose .
```

**Important:** Make sure you've installed the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker).

Run the following cmd:

```shell
docker run --gpus all\
 --shm-size=8g \
 -it -v {DATA_DIR}:/mmpose/data mmpose
```
