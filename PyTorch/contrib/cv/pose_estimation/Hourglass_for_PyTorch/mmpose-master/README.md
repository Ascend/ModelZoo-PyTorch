MMPose is an open-source toolbox for pose estimation based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the [OpenMMLab project](https://github.com/open-mmlab).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3+**.

### Major Features

- **Support diverse tasks**

  We support a wide spectrum of mainstream human pose analysis tasks in current research community, including 2d multi-person human pose estimation, 2d hand pose estimation, 133 keypoint whole-body human pose estimation, and 3d human mesh recovery.

- **Higher efficiency and higher accuracy**

  MMPose implements multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models, including both top-down & bottom-up approaches. We achieve faster training speed and higher accuracy than other popular codebases, such as [HRNet](https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch).
  See [benchmark.md](docs/benchmark.md) for more information.

- **Support for various datasets**

  The toolbox directly supports multiple popular and representative datasets, COCO, AIC, MPII, MPII-TRB, OCHuman etc.
  See [data_preparation.md](docs/data_preparation.md) for more information.

- **Well designed, tested and documented**

  We decompose MMPose into different components and one can easily construct a customized
  pose estimation framework by combining different modules.
  We provide detailed documentation and API reference, as well as unittests.
