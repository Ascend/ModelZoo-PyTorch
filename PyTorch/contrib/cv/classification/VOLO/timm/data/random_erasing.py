        'Random Erasing Data Augmentation' by Zhong et al.
        See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04896.pdf

        This variant of RandomErasing is intended to be applied to either a batch
        or single image tensor after it has been normalized by dataset mean and std.
    Args:
         probability: Probability that the Random Erasing operation will be performed.
         min_area: Minimum percentage of erased area wrt input image area.
         max_area: Maximum percentage of erased area wrt input image area.
         min_aspect: Minimum aspect ratio of erased area.
         mode: pixel color mode, one of 'const', 'rand', or 'pixel'
            'const' - erase block is constant color of 0 for all channels
            'rand'  - erase block is same per-channel random (normal) color
            'pixel' - erase block is per-pixel random (normal) color
        max_count: maximum number of erasing blocks per image, area per box is scaled by count.
            per-image count is randomly chosen between 1 and this value.
