# Res2Net101_v1b

This implements training of Res2Net101_v1b on the ImageNet dataset, mainly modified from [pytorch/examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet).

# Res2Net101_v1b Detail

# Requirements

Install PyTorch (pytorch.org)
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the ImageNet dataset from http://www.image-net.org/
Then, and move validation images to labeled subfolders, using [the following shell script]

# Training

To train a model, run main.py with the desired model architecture and the path to the ImageNet dataset:

# 1p training 1p
bash ./test/train_full_1p.sh  --data_path=xxx          # training accuracy

bash ./test/train_performance_1p.sh  --data_path=xxx   # training performance

# 8p training 8p
bash ./test/train_full_8p.sh  --data_path=xxx          # training accuracy

bash ./test/train_performance_8p.sh  --data_path=xxx   # training performance

# eval default 8pï¼Œ should support 1p
bash ./test/train_eval_8p.sh  --data_path=xxx

# O2 online inference demo
source scripts/set_npu_env.sh
python3.7.5 demo.py

# O2 To ONNX
source scripts/set_npu_env.sh
python3.7.5 pthtar2onnx.py

# Res2Net101_v1b training result
