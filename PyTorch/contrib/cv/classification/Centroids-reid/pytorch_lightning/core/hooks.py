            batch: A batch of data that needs to be transferred to a new device.
            device: The target device as defined in PyTorch.

        Returns:
            A reference to the data on the new device.

        Note:
            This hook should only transfer the data and not modify it, nor should it move the data to
            any other device than the one passed in as argument (unless you know what you are doing).

        Note:
            This hook only runs on single GPU training and DDP.
            If you need multi-GPU support for your custom batch objects in ``dp`` or ``ddp2``,
            you need to define your custom :class:`~torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` or
            :class:`~pytorch_lightning.overrides.data_parallel.LightningDistributedDataParallel` and
            override :meth:`~pytorch_lightning.core.lightning.LightningModule.configure_ddp`.

        Called by Lightning to restore your model.
