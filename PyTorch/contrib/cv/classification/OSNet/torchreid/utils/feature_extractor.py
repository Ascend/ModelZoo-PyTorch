    """A simple API for feature extraction.

    FeatureExtractor can be used like a python function, which
    accepts input of the following types:
        - a list of strings (image paths)
        - a list of numpy.ndarray each with shape (H, W, C)
        - a single string (image path)
        - a single numpy.ndarray with shape (H, W, C)
        - a torch.Tensor with shape (B, C, H, W) or (C, H, W)

    Returned is a torch tensor with shape (B, D) where D is the
    feature dimension.

    Args:
        model_name (str): model name.
        model_path (str): path to model weights.
        image_size (sequence or int): image height and width.
        pixel_mean (list): pixel mean for normalization.
        pixel_std (list): pixel std for normalization.
        pixel_norm (bool): whether to normalize pixels.
        device (str): 'cpu' or 'cuda' (could be specific gpu devices).
        verbose (bool): show model details.

    Examples::

        from torchreid.utils import FeatureExtractor

            model_name='osnet_x1_0',
