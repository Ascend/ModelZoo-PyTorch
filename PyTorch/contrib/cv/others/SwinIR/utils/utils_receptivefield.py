# [filter size, stride, padding]
#Assume the two dimensions are the same
#Each kernel requires the following parameters:
# - k_i: kernel size
# - s_i: stride
# - p_i: padding (if padding is uneven, right padding will higher than left padding; "SAME" option in tensorflow)
# 
#Each layer i requires the following parameters to be fully represented: 
# - n_i: number of feature (data layer has n_1 = imagesize )
# - j_i: distance (projected to image pixel distance) between center of two adjacent features
# - r_i: receptive field of a feature in layer i
# - start_i: position of the first feature's receptive field in layer i (idx start from 0, negative means the center fall into padding)
