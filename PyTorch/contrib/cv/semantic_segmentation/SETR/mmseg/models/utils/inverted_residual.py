class InvertedResidual(nn.Module):
    """InvertedResidual block for MobileNetV2.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): The input channels of the InvertedResidual block.
        out_channels (int): The output channels of the InvertedResidual block.
        stride (int): Stride of the middle (first) 3x3 convolution.
        expand_ratio (int): Adjusts number of channels of the hidden layer
            in InvertedResidual by this amount.
        dilation (int): Dilation rate of depthwise conv. Default: 1
        conv_cfg (dict): Config dict for convolution layer.
            Default: None, which means using conv2d.
        norm_cfg (dict): Config dict for normalization layer.
            Default: dict(type='BN').
        act_cfg (dict): Config dict for activation layer.
            Default: dict(type='ReLU6').
        with_cp (bool): Use checkpoint or not. Using checkpoint will save some
            memory while slowing down the training speed. Default: False.

    Returns:
        Tensor: The output tensor
