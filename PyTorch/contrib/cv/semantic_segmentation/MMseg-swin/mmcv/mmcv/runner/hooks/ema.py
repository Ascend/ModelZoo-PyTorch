    Use Exponential Moving Average on all parameters of model in training

    as below. EMAHook takes priority over EvalHook and CheckpointSaverHook.

        momentum (float): The momentum used for updating ema parameter.
            Defaults to 0.0002.
        interval (int): Update ema parameter every interval iteration.
            Defaults to 1.
        warm_up (int): During first warm_up steps, we may use smaller momentum
            to update ema parameters more slowly. Defaults to 100.
