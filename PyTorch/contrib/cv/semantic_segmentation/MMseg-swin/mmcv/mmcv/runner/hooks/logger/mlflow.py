            Default None. If not None, set the active experiment.
            If experiment does not exist, an experiment with provided name

        tags (Dict[str], optional): Tags for the current run.
            Default None. If not None, set tags for the current run.
        log_model (bool, optional): Whether to log an MLflow artifact.
            Default True. If True, log runner.model as an MLflow artifact
            for the current run.
        interval (int): Logging interval (every k iterations). Default: 10.
        ignore_last (bool): Ignore the log of last iterations in each epoch
            if less than `interval`. Default: True.
        reset_flag (bool): Whether to clear the output buffer after logging.
            Default: False.
        by_epoch (bool): Whether EpochBasedRunner is used. Default: True.
