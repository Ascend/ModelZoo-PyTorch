    Args:
        tensor (torch.Tensor): Tensor that contains multiple images, shape (
            N, C, H, W). :math:`C` can be either 3 or 1.
        mean (tuple[float], optional): Mean of images. If None,
            (0, 0, 0) will be used for tensor with 3-channel,
            while (0, ) for tensor with 1-channel. Defaults to None.
        std (tuple[float], optional): Standard deviation of images. If None,
            (1, 1, 1) will be used for tensor with 3-channel,
            while (1, ) for tensor with 1-channel. Defaults to None.
        to_rgb (bool, optional): Whether the tensor was converted to RGB
            format in the first place. If so, convert it back to BGR.
            For the tensor with 1 channel, it must be False. Defaults to True.
