    """The MPSDataParallel module that supports DataContainer.

    MPSDataParallel is a class inherited from MMDataParall, which supports
    MPS training and inference only.

    The main differences with MMDataParallel:

    - It only supports single-card of MPS, and only use first card to
      run training and inference.

    - It uses direct host-to-device copy instead of stream-background
      scatter.

    Args:
        module (:class:`nn.Module`): Module to be encapsulated.
        dim (int): Dimension used to scatter the data. Defaults to 0.
