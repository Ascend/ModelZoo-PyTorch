## Introduction

MMSegmentation is an open source semantic segmentation toolbox based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the OpenMMLab project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.6**.

### Major features

- **Unified Benchmark**

  We provide a unified benchmark toolbox for various semantic segmentation methods.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the semantic segmentation framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized semantic segmentation framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple methods out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary semantic segmentation frameworks, *e.g.* PSPNet, DeepLabV3, PSANet, DeepLabV3+, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/install.md) for installation and dataset preparation.

## Get Started

Please see [getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md) for the basic usage of MMSegmentation.
There are also tutorials for [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/new_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), and [adding new modules](docs/tutorials/new_modules.md).

A Colab tutorial is also provided. You may preview the notebook [here](demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) or directly [run](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) on Colab.

## Contributing

We appreciate all contributions to improve MMSegmentation. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributing guideline.

## Acknowledgement

MMSegmentation is an open source project that welcome any contribution and feedback.
We wish that the toolbox and benchmark could serve the growing research
community by providing a flexible as well as standardized toolkit to reimplement existing methods
and develop their own new semantic segmentation methods.
