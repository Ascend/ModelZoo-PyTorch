        channels (int): The input (and output) channels of the SE layer.
        ratio (int): Squeeze ratio in SELayer, the intermediate channel will be
            ``int(channels/ratio)``. Default: 16.
        conv_cfg (None or dict): Config dict for convolution layer.
            Default: None, which means using conv2d.
        act_cfg (dict or Sequence[dict]): Config dict for activation layer.
            If act_cfg is a dict, two activation layers will be configurated
            by this dict. If act_cfg is a sequence of dicts, the first
            activation layer will be configurated by the first dict and the
            second activation layer will be configurated by the second dict.
