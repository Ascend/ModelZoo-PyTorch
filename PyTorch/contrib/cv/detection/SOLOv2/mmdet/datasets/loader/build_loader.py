    In distributed training, each GPU/process has a dataloader.

        dataset (Dataset): A PyTorch dataset.
        imgs_per_gpu (int): Number of images on each GPU, i.e., batch size of
            each GPU.
        workers_per_gpu (int): How many subprocesses to use for data loading
            for each GPU.
        num_gpus (int): Number of GPUs. Only used in non-distributed training.
        dist (bool): Distributed training/test or not. Default: True.
        shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the data at every epoch.
            Default: True.
        kwargs: any keyword argument to be used to initialize DataLoader
