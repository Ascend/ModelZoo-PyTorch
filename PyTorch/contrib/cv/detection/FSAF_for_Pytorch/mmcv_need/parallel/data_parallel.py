    MMDataParallel has two main differences with PyTorch DataParallel:

    - It supports a custom type :class:`DataContainer` which allows more
      flexible control of input data during both GPU and CPU inference.
    - It implement two more APIs ``train_step()`` and ``val_step()``.

    Args:
        module (:class:`nn.Module`): Module to be encapsulated.
        device_ids (list[int]): Device IDS of modules to be scattered to.
            Defaults to None when GPU is not available.
