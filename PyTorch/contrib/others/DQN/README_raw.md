Modularized implementation of popular deep RL algorithms in PyTorch.  
Easy switch between toy tasks and challenging games.

Implemented algorithms:
* (Double/Dueling/Prioritized) Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
* Categorical DQN (C51)
* Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN)
* (Continuous/Discrete) Synchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
* Synchronous N-Step Q-Learning (N-Step DQN)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* The Option-Critic Architecture (OC)
* Twined Delayed DDPG (TD3)
* [DifferentialGQ/MVPI/ReverseRL/COF-PAC/GradientDICE/Bi-Res-DDPG/DAC/Geoff-PAC/QUOTA/ACE](#code-of-my-papers)

The DQN agent, as well as C51 and QR-DQN, has an asynchronous actor for data generation and an asynchronous replay buffer for transferring data to GPU.
Using 1 RTX 2080 Ti and 3 threads, the DQN agent runs for 10M steps (40M frames, 2.5M gradient updates) for Breakout within 6 hours.
