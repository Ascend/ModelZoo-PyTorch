class FairseqIncrementalDecoder(FairseqDecoder):
    """Base class for incremental decoders.

    Incremental decoding is a special mode at inference time where the Model
    only receives a single timestep of input corresponding to the previous
    output token (for teacher forcing) and must produce the next output
    *incrementally*. Thus the model must cache any long-term state that is
    needed about the sequence, e.g., hidden states, convolutional states, etc.

    Compared to the standard :class:`FairseqDecoder` interface, the incremental
    decoder interface allows :func:`forward` functions to take an extra keyword
    argument (*incremental_state*) that can be used to cache state across
    time-steps.

    The :class:`FairseqIncrementalDecoder` interface also defines the
    :func:`reorder_incremental_state` method, which is used during beam search
    to select and reorder the incremental state based on the selection of beams.

    To learn more about how incremental decoding works, refer to `this blog
    <http://www.telesens.co/2019/04/21/understanding-incremental-decoding-in-fairseq/>`_.
