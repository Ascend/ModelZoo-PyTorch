Templates
---------

These templates should serve as a good starting point for developing new
recipes with the SpeechBrain toolkit. They are simple, well-documented,
and contain all the parts necessary for a working recipe. They cover
a broad spectrum of types of tasks that are encountered in speech
research, such as sequence regression (enhancement), sequence
to sequence (speech_recognition), and sequence classification (speaker ID).
