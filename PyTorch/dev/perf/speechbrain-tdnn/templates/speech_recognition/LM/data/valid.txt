SO HE CAME IN EXACTLY THAT WAY LIKE A ROBBER BUT REALLY ONLY TO KEEP A TRYST WITH HIS LADY LOVE A PRETTY STORY A TRUE ROMANCE
THAT BROUGHT A START FROM JOHN MARK AND A FLASH OF EAGERNESS BUT HE REPRESSED THE IDEA AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE GIRL WE'VE SHAKEN HANDS HE ADMITTED SLOWLY AS THOUGH JUST REALIZING THE FULL EXTENT OF THE MEANING OF THAT ACT
THE GUN PARTNER AND IF YOU COULDN'T GET THE GIRL BUT SEE HOW ABSURD THE WHOLE THING IS RONICKY DOONE I SEND FOR THE GIRL I REQUEST HER TO GO DOWN WITH YOU TO THE STREET AND TAKE A WALK BECAUSE YOU WISH TO TALK TO HER
YOU FOLLOWED HIS TRAIL UP THE STAIRS TO THE KITCHEN AND DOWN THE HALL AND UP TO HARRY'S ROOM WE ALREADY KNEW HE'D GONE THERE BUT HE LEFT THAT ROOM AGAIN AND CAME DOWN THE HALL YES
YOU FOOL THEY SIMPLY GREW DIM WHEN THEY GOT TO THIS DOOR I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SOME TIME GO BACK AND TELL THEM TO HUNT SOME MORE GO UP TO THE ATTIC AND SEARCH THERE THAT'S THE PLACE AN AMATEUR WOULD MOST LIKELY HIDE
THE MAN GROWLED SOME RETORT AND LEFT CLOSING THE DOOR HEAVILY BEHIND HIM WHILE RONICKY DOONE BREATHED FREELY AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW SAID THE MAN OF THE SNEER TELL ME THE WHOLE OF IT RUTH RONICKY SET HIS TEETH
THIS CAROLINE SMITH MAY BE A PERSON OF GREAT VALUE TO ME I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE IS BUT I GOT A GOOD ARGUMENT
THAT DROPPED HIM INTO THE COAL BIN DID HE GET COAL DUST ON HIS SHOES RIGHT AND HE DIDN'T HAVE SENSE ENOUGH TO WIPE IT OFF AN AMATEUR A RANK AMATEUR I TOLD YOU SAID THE MAN OF THE SNEER WITH SATISFACTION
DO YOU SUPPOSE I'LL REST IDLE AND LET YOU WALK AWAY WITH HER ONCE WE'RE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE MARK SAID RONICKY DOONE I DON'T ASK NO FAVORS LET YOUR MEN COME ON
AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE STOLEN THE MONEY YOURSELF AND I DIDN'T SAID JIMMIE DALE I FOUND IT HIDDEN IN THE HOME OF ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES
SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW
FOR AN INSTANT NEITHER MAN SPOKE NOR MOVED THEN CARLING SPARE BUILT DAPPER IN EVENING CLOTHES EDGED BACK FROM THE DESK AND LAUGHED A LITTLE UNCERTAINLY
IN HARLEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECRETING THEM SOMEWHERE THERE YOU PRETENDED TO BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED AT FINDING MOYNE OUT YOU HAD JUST COME FOR A LITTLE SOCIAL VISIT
THOUGH I EXPECTED YOU WOULD TELEPHONE RATHER THAN THIS COME IN THANK YOU SAID JIMMIE DALE COURTEOUSLY AND STEPPED INTO THE HALL THE OTHER CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR THE SERVANTS ARE IN BED OF COURSE
STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS
IN A MEASURE AT LEAST SEEMED TO FORSAKE HIM HE BEGAN TO DRUM NERVOUSLY WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE DESK AND SHIFT UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AND THEN FROM FIRST ONE POCKET AND THEN THE OTHER
WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
AND HE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT HIS VOICE WAS AN INCOHERENT MUTTERING I'LL NOT WASTE WORDS SAID JIMMIE DALE IN HIS GRIM MONOTONE I'M NOT SURE ENOUGH MYSELF THAT I COULD KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU MUCH LONGER
EXTRACTED THE KEY FROM THE DOOR LOCK HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER TO SEE THEN DROPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET AND HIS VOICE COLD BEFORE
AT THE CORNER HE STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE AND THE FLAME OF THE MATCH SPURTING UP DISCLOSED A FACE THAT WAS WORN AND HAGGARD HE THREW THE MATCH AWAY SMILED A LITTLE WEARILY AND WENT ON
IN MOYNE'S HOME UP IN HARLEM
AND THEN JIMMIE DALE LAUGHED NOT PLEASANTLY YES THERE'S A WAY CARLING HE SAID GRIMLY THAT'S WHY I'M HERE HE PICKED UP A SHEET OF WRITING PAPER AND PUSHED IT ACROSS THE DESK THEN A PEN
YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED TO NIGHT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND HERE THE OTHER NINETY THOUSAND ARE IN YOUR SAFE YOU LIE ASHEN TO THE LIPS CARLING HAD RISEN IN HIS CHAIR
AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD DONE THE JOB AND HAD THE BALANCE SOMEWHERE WHAT WOULD HIS DENIALS HIS PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE COUNT FOR HE WAS AN EX CONVICT A HARDENED CRIMINAL CAUGHT RED HANDED WITH A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF ROBBERY
JIMMIE DALE THERE'S JUST ONE REASON ONLY ONE THAT KEEPS ME FROM PUTTING A BULLET THROUGH YOU WHILE YOU SIT THERE WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT THERE IS THAT LITTLE STORY FIRST SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU NOW
A SMALL GLASS VIAL ROLLED UPON THE CARPET AND THEN EVEN AS JIMMIE DALE SPRANG FORWARD THE OTHER PITCHED HEAD LONG OVER THE COUCH AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS OVER PRESENTLY JIMMIE DALE PICKED UP THE VIAL
NO NO CARLING PUSHED AWAY THE PEN I'M RUINED RUINED AS IT IS BUT THIS WOULD MEAN THE PENITENTIARY TOO WHERE YOU TRIED TO SEND AN INNOCENT MAN IN YOUR PLACE YOU HOUND WHERE YOU SOME OTHER WAY
HIS LIPS WERE WORKING MECHANICALLY HE SANK DOWN AGAIN IN HIS CHAIR JIMMIE DALE STILL LEANED OVER THE DESK RESTING HIS WEIGHT ON HIS RIGHT ELBOW THE AUTOMATIC IN HIS RIGHT HAND COVERING CARLING YOU CUR WHISPERED
JIMMIE DALE LEANED FORWARD FROM HEADQUARTERS WITH A REPORT HE SAID IN A LOW TONE AH EXCLAIMED THE BANK OFFICIAL SHARPLY WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME I'VE BEEN WAITING UP FOR IT
IT WAS ENOUGH WASN'T IT WHAT CHANCE HAD HE JIMMIE DALE PAUSED HIS LEFT HAND CLENCHED UNTIL THE SKIN FORMED WHITISH KNOBS OVER THE KNUCKLES CARLING'S TONGUE SOUGHT HIS LIPS MADE A CIRCUIT OF THEM
FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AND GOD KNOWS HOW MANY BEFORE THAT YOU'VE GONE THE PACE THE LAVISHNESS OF THIS BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT OF YOURS IS COMMON TALK IN NEW YORK FAR IN EXCESS OF A BANK CASHIER'S SALARY
WHEN YOU MUST HAVE MONEY OR FACE RUIN AND EXPOSURE YOU SAW IT THEN A YEAR AGO THE DAY THAT MOYNE CONCEALING NOTHING OF HIS PRISON RECORD APPLIED THROUGH FRIENDS FOR A POSITION IN THE BANK
THE PEN SPLUTTERED ON THE PAPER A BEAD OF SWEAT SPURTING FROM THE MAN'S FOREHEAD DROPPED TO THE SHEET THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM A MINUTE PASSED ANOTHER
I WANT TO SEE MISTER THOMAS H CARLING CASHIER OF THE HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SAID JIMMIE DALE EARNESTLY I AM MISTER CARLING REPLIED THE OTHER WHAT IS IT

YOU WANT TO PLEAD FOR HIM CARLING FLUNG OUT GRUFFLY WELL HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT BEFORE IT'S QUITE USELESS FOR YOU TO BRING IT UP THE MAN HAS HAD HIS CHANCE ALREADY
AND IT WAS SAFER MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ON YOUR PART NOT TO ORDER THE FLAT SEARCHED AT ONCE BUT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT AS IT WERE AFTER YOU HAD LED THE POLICE TO TRAIL HIM ALL EVENING AND STILL REMAIN WITHOUT A CLEW
WHO KNEW AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY NOW SINCE THE MAN WAS DEAD JIMMIE DALE PUT THE PIECES IN HIS POCKET WENT TO THE SAFE OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT A PARCEL LOCKED THE SAFE CAREFULLY
EXPOSURE THREATENING YOU AT ANY MOMENT WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME AGAIN THAT I LIE CARLING BUT NOW THE MAN MADE NO ANSWER HE HAD SUNK A LITTLE DEEPER IN HIS CHAIR
TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME LIFE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES MISSUS MOYNE WAS GENUINELY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL
AND NOTIFIED THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANK BY TELEPHONE FROM HERE OF THE ROBBERY SUGGESTING THAT POLICE HEADQUARTERS BE ADVISED AT ONCE HE TOLD YOU TO GO AHEAD AND ACT AS YOU SAW BEST YOU NOTIFIED THE POLICE
I GUESS IT'S ALL UP I GUESS I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOME DAY MOYNE HADN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT I STOLE THE MONEY MYSELF FROM THE BANK TO NIGHT I GUESS IT'S ALL UP
BUT BEFORE LEAVING YOU PRETENDED TO DISCOVER THE THEFT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT DONE UP IN A PAPER PARCEL WAS EVEN THEN REPOSING IN YOUR DESK YOU BROUGHT THE PARCEL HOME PUT IT IN THAT SAFE THERE
HELD A DISCONCERTING BEAD ON CARLING'S FOREHEAD PLEASE DON'T DO THAT SAID JIMMIE DALE SOFTLY IT'S RATHER A GOOD MAKE THAT SAFE I DARE SAY IT WOULD TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO OPEN IT
AND CARRIED THE PARCEL TO THE DESK HE OPENED IT THERE INSIDE WERE NEARLY TWO DOZEN LITTLE PACKAGES OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS THE OTHER TWO PACKAGES THAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM HE ADDED TO THE REST

BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A WEALTHY MAN IN YOUR OWN RIGHT AND SO IN REALITY YOU WERE ONCE BUT YOU WENT THROUGH YOUR FORTUNE TWO YEARS AGO
WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
CARLING'S PEN TRAVELLED HALTINGLY ACROSS THE PAPER THEN WITH A QUEER LOW CRY AS HE SIGNED HIS NAME HE DROPPED THE PEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND RISING UNSTEADILY FROM HIS CHAIR
AS HE SMILED IN PRIVATE YOU'VE A STRANGE METHOD OF SECURING PRIVACY HAVEN'T YOU A BIT MELODRAMATIC ISN'T IT
HIS VOICE WAS RISING GRADUALLY WELL SIR LET ME TELL YOU THAT MISTER CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE IN A LOW EVEN TONE UNLESS YOU MODERATE YOUR VOICE SOME ONE IN THE HOUSE MIGHT HEAR YOU I AM QUITE WELL AWARE OF THAT
THE EX CONVICT IN THE BANK'S EMPLOY YOU KNEW MOYNE WAS DINING OUT TO NIGHT YOU KNEW WHERE AND AT A HINT FROM YOU THE POLICE TOOK UP THE TRAIL A LITTLE LATER IN THE EVENING YOU TOOK THESE TWO PACKAGES OF BANKNOTES FROM THE REST
FROM HIS POCKET HE TOOK OUT THE THIN METAL INSIGNIA CASE AND WITH THE TINY TWEEZERS LIFTED UP ONE OF THE GRAY COLOURED DIAMOND SHAPED PAPER SEALS HE MOISTENED THE ADHESIVE SIDE AND
THOMAS H CARLING FROM THE PAPER JIMMIE DALE'S EYES SHIFTED TO THE FIGURE BY THE COUCH AND THE PAPER FLUTTERED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FINGERS TO THE DESK CARLING WAS REELING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT
OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
HE LEANED BACK AND SURVEYED JIMMIE DALE CRITICALLY WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK EYES AH QUITE SO HE OBSERVED THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE MASK BUT I AM STILL A LITTLE IN THE DARK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
STILL HOLDING IT BY THE TWEEZERS DROPPED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PRESSED THE SEAL DOWN ON THE FACE OF THE TOPMOST PACKAGE OF BANKNOTES HE TIED THE PARCEL UP THEN AND PICKING UP THE PEN ADDRESSED IT IN PRINTED CHARACTERS
CARLING WAS BABBLING LET ME OUT OF THIS FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME OUT OF THIS CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE HOARSELY I STOOD BESIDE A LITTLE BED TO NIGHT AND LOOKED AT A BABY GIRL A LITTLE BABY GIRL WITH GOLDEN HAIR
WHAT HAS A STORY GOT TO DO WITH THIS SNAPPED CARLING THE MAN HAS GOT A HOME SAID JIMMIE DALE SOFTLY A HOME AND A WIFE AND A LITTLE BABY GIRL
AND BESIDES OF COURSE NOT UNTIL YOU HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS TO DAMN HIM AND WRECK HIS LIFE AND HOME YOU WERE EVEN GENEROUS IN THE AMOUNT YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF OF OUT OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
BUT YOU HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE RETURNING THE MONEY TO THE BANK EXACTLY SAID JIMMIE DALE CARLING WAS ONCE MORE THE POMPOUS BANK OFFICIAL
LIFTED UNTIL THE MUZZLE WAS ON A LINE WITH CARLING'S EYES CARLING'S HAND REACHED OUT STILL SHAKING AND TOOK THE PEN AND HIS BODY DRAGGED LIMPLY FORWARD HUNG OVER THE DESK
I'LL TELEPHONE HEADQUARTERS TO MAKE THE ARREST AT ONCE JUST A MINUTE INTERPOSED JIMMIE DALE GRAVELY I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE STORY FIRST A STORY
JIMMIE DALE MOVED OVER AND STOOD IN FRONT OF CARLING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK AND STARED SILENTLY AT THE IMMACULATE FASHIONABLY GROOMED FIGURE BEFORE HIM UNDER THE PROLONGED GAZE CARLING'S COMPOSURE
MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
WHO WAS ALREADY ASLEEP IN BED
YOU LIE HE CRIED DO YOU HEAR YOU LIE I TELL YOU YOU LIE JIMMIE DALE'S LIPS PARTED OMINOUSLY SIT DOWN HE GRITTED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THE WHITE IN CARLING'S FACE HAD TURNED TO GRAY
THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF HOW YOU STOLE THE MONEY TO DAY DO NOT MATTER NOW A LITTLE LATER PERHAPS IN COURT BUT NOT NOW YOU WERE THE LAST TO LEAVE THE BANK
SAID CARLING ICILY YOU REFUSE ABSOLUTELY JIMMIE DALE'S VOICE HAD A LINGERING WISTFUL NOTE IN IT I REFUSE SAID CARLING BLUNTLY I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS
HE HAD REACHED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM NOW AND WITH A QUICK SUDDEN MOVEMENT JERKED HIS HAND TO THE DIAL OF THE SAFE THAT STOOD AGAINST THE WALL BUT JIMMIE DALE WAS QUICKER WITHOUT SHIFTING HIS POSITION HIS AUTOMATIC WHIPPED FROM HIS POCKET
A DAWNING LOOK OF TERROR IN THE EYES THAT HELD FASCINATED ON JIMMIE DALE YOU CUR SAID JIMMIE DALE AGAIN YOU CUR WITH YOUR DEVIL'S WORK A YEAR AGO YOU SAW THIS NIGHT COMING
THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS IN DARKNESS YES SAID JIMMIE DALE NODDING HIS HEAD I RATHER THOUGHT SO THE SERVANTS WILL HAVE RETIRED HOURS AGO IT'S SAFE ENOUGH
AND WITH THIS STEAMSHIP TICKET WHICH YOU OBTAINED YESTERDAY WHILE OUT AT LUNCH BY SENDING A DISTRICT MESSENGER BOY WITH THE MONEY AND INSTRUCTIONS IN A SEALED ENVELOPE TO PURCHASE FOR YOU YOU WENT UP TO THE MOYNES FLAT
WHO SMILED AS SHE SLEPT CARLING SHIVERED AND PASSED A SHAKING HAND ACROSS HIS FACE TAKE THIS PEN SAID JIMMIE DALE MONOTONOUSLY OR THIS THE AUTOMATIC
YOU'RE WISER THAN YOU KNOW MY MAN THAT'S WHAT WE SUSPECTED
HE EXPLAINED AS HE LED THE WAY TOWARD THE LIGHTED ROOM THIS WAY PLEASE BEHIND THE OTHER ACROSS THE HALL JIMMIE DALE FOLLOWED AND CLOSE AT CARLING'S HEELS ENTERED THE ROOM WHICH WAS FITTED UP
QUITE EVIDENTLY REGARDLESS OF COST AS A COMBINATION LIBRARY AND STUDY CARLING IN A SOMEWHAT POMPOUS FASHION WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD TOWARD THE CARVED MAHOGANY FLAT TOPPED DESK AND AS HE REACHED IT
YOUR CO OFFICIALS WERE OPPOSED TO HIS APPOINTMENT BUT YOU DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU PLEADED TO GIVE THE MAN HIS CHANCE AND IN YOUR HELLISH INGENUITY SAW YOUR WAY THEN OUT OF THE TRAP AN EX CONVICT FROM SING SING
YOU JIMMIE DALE'S VOICE CHOKED AGAIN YOU BLOT ON GOD'S EARTH YOU SLIPPED THE MONEY AND TICKET UNDER THE CHILD'S MATTRESS CARLING CAME FORWARD WITH A LURCH IN HIS CHAIR AND HIS HANDS WENT OUT
WHICH STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE HERE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY A BEAUTIFUL LADY DRESSED IN GREEN AND WHITE TO MATCH THE HOUSE WHICH APPARENTLY BELONGED TO HER AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED THE ONLY INHABITANT
HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
CHARMS WOULD WIN ALL HEARTS WHEN THE THREE GREEN AND WHITE SISTERS APPEARED THEY DECLARED THE SECRET OF FAIRY THAN A FAIRY'S ROYAL BIRTH AND THE QUEEN TAKING THE TWO LOVERS IN HER CARRIAGE SET OFF WITH THEM FOR THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM
THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
THAN THEY RESOLVED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER WHO BORE IT AND EITHER TO TORMENT HER CRUELLY OR AT LEAST TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF ALL MEN THE ELDEST OF THEIR TRIBE WAS ENTRUSTED TO CARRY OUT THEIR REVENGE THIS FAIRY WAS NAMED LAGREE
HE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCE
IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN IN PEACE TO REIGN OVER HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE LONGING FOR HIS PRESENCE THE COURT RECEIVED THE NEW KING WITH JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM AT ANY OTHER TIME
THE VOICE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN AND ITS SWEETNESS OF TONE AND THE AGREEABLE THINGS IT UTTERED LED ONE TO INFER THAT ITS OWNER MUST BE EQUALLY CHARMING BUT THIS HAD TO BE A MERE MATTER OF FANCY FOR NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
STARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHT
IN THE FIRST AND MOST SPLENDID OF THESE CARRIAGES SAT PRINCE RAINBOW'S MOTHER SHE FONDLY EMBRACED HER SON AFTER WHICH SHE INFORMED HIM THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS THAT THE ANGER OF THE FAIRIES WAS AT LENGTH APPEASED
HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THANKED HER WARMLY AND RESUMED HER WAY CHEERED BY PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLE
LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
CONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER
SHE GAVE HER A NUT DESIRING HER ONLY TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST URGENT NEED AFTER A LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY FAIRER THAN A FAIRY WAS ONCE MORE RECEIVED IN A HOUSE AND BY A LADY EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE SHE
AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
FAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLES
AS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE SHE CARRIED TOUCHED THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY A GREEN AND SHADY BOWER SPRANG UP ROUND HER IN WHICH SHE HOPED TO SLEEP IN PEACE BUT LAGREE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HER PURSUIT
SHE WAS ALSO SO SPITEFUL THAT SHE GLADLY DEVOTED ALL HER TIME TO CARRYING OUT ALL THE MEAN OR ILL NATURED TRICKS OF THE WHOLE BODY OF FAIRIES WITH HER LARGE EXPERIENCE ADDED TO HER NATIVE SPITE
BEGGED HER NOT TO LOSE HEART AND ASSURED HER THAT HER TROUBLES SHOULD BE REWARDED SHE ACCOMPANIED HER ADVICE BY THE GIFT OF A CRYSTAL SMELLING BOTTLE WITH STRICT ORDERS ONLY TO OPEN IT IN CASE OF URGENT NEED
THAT THEY WISHED THEIR HOUSES AND GARMENTS TO BE EQUALLY ALIKE THEIR OCCUPATION CONSISTED IN HELPING THOSE IN MISFORTUNE AND THEY WERE AS GENTLE AND BENEVOLENT AS LAGREE HAD BEEN CRUEL AND SPITEFUL THE THIRD FAIRY COMFORTED THE POOR TRAVELLER
SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
SHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFT
BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
AND HAVING ENFORCED HER ORDERS WITH THE MOST AWFUL THREATS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE SHE VANISHED LEAVING THE LITTLE GIRL AT LIBERTY TO EXPLORE THE PALACE
SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKS
WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
ONCE THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD NO CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE AT LENGTH HEAVEN GRANTED HIM A DAUGHTER OF SUCH REMARKABLE BEAUTY THAT HE COULD THINK OF NO NAME SO APPROPRIATE FOR HER AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY
FOR FIRE WITH WHICH TO RELIGHT THE ONE SHE HAD ALLOWED TO GO OUT NOW THIS LOCRINOS WAS A CRUEL MONSTER WHO DEVOURED EVERYONE HE CAME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED A CHANCE OF CATCHING
AT THE SAME TIME GIVING HER THE STRICTEST ORDERS NEVER TO LET OUT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE SHE THEN GAVE TWO GLASS BOTTLES INTO THE PRINCESS'S CHARGE DESIRING HER TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM
IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE
SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR
AND LIKED TO SLEEP IN A SMALL ROOM SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKE WHEN HE CAME UP BUT HAD BEEN HALF AROUSED AS USUALLY HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHT WAS SWITCHED ON IN HER HUSBAND'S ROOM SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
THEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVER
WITH A LOOK OF SINCERE GRATITUDE IN HER EYES SHE WAS MUCH BETTER NOW SHE SAID AND A CUP OF TEA WOULD WORK A MIRACLE UPON HER SHE HOPED SHE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM ANYTHING IMPORTANT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF
I ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROL
THE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATS
AND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
THE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PROVED BY HIS WIFE THE FIRST WITNESS CALLED FROM WHOM THE CORONER AFTER SOME INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECEASED
HE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MORE
SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED THOSE LAST QUESTIONS I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT HEAR ME SHE SAID WHEN HE EXPLAINED BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL READ IT ALL IN THE REPORTS
PRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATIC
RUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIM
HIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGE
CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
SHE COULD DRAG HIM FROM THE PLACE THEN AGAIN SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON IT AND WITH THAT SUPPORT AND WITH BENT HEAD SHE WALKED SLOWLY FROM THE HOTEL AND ALONG THE OAK SHADED PATH TOWARD WHITE GABLES
HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF JOVIAL TEMPER WITH A STRONG INTEREST IN THE DRAMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLAND
