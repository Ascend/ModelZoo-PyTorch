# Dataset will be downloaded to the `data_folder`
# If you plan to train a system on an HPC cluster with a big dataset,
# we strongly suggest doing the following:
# 1- Compress the dataset in a single tar or zip file.
# 2- Copy your dataset locally (i.e., the local disk of the computing node).
# 3- Uncompress the dataset in the local folder.
# 4- Set data_folder with the local path.
# Reading data from the local disk of the compute node (e.g. $SLURM_TMPDIR with SLURM-based clusters) is very important.
# It allows you to read the data much faster without slowing down the shared filesystem.
