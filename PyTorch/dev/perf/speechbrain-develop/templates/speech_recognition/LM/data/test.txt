HE STARTED AS HE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT BOW TO HEAR MISSUS MANDERSON ADDRESS HIM BY NAME IN A LOW VOICE HE FOLLOWED HER A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL I WANTED TO ASK YOU
AND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DID
BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
SOMETHING WAS BETWEEN US I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AND HE NEVER TOLD ME MY OWN OBSTINATE PRIDE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING WHAT IT WAS IN SO MANY WORDS
THE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOW
THE WORD WAS COLORLESSLY SPOKEN BUT EVERYONE FELT THAT A CRASS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONDUCT IN THE CASE OF A PERSON LIKE MISSUS MANDERSON HAD BEEN VISITED WITH SOME SEVERITY DID SHE KNOW THE CORONER ASKED
SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
AND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
OF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOOR
PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFORE
BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT MARTIN HE WAS OBSERVING THE WELL BALANCED FIGURE THAT CAME QUICKLY TOWARD HIM ALONG AN OPENING PATH IN THE CROWD AND HIS EYE WAS GLOOMY
THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
HE WAS STILL CURSING HIMSELF FURIOUSLY BEHIND THE MASK OF CONVENTIONAL SOLICITUDE THAT HE TURNED TO THE LADY WHEN HE HAD ATTENDED HER TO THE HOUSE AND SEEN HER SINK UPON A COUCH IN THE MORNING ROOM
HE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLY
WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
YES SIR SAID THE SERVANT SUCH AN INSTRUCTION WAS REMARKABLY PLEASING TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH THAT HE HAD TO DO AND THAT NIGHT'S FREEDOM WOULD ASSIST HIM MATERIALLY PERHAPS KARA HESITATED PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM
YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR
KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID
NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOB FOR THE PURPOSE AND LET IT FALL GENTLY INTO THE SOCKET WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO RECEIVE IT ON THE DOOR ITSELF RUM COVE HE SAID AGAIN AND LIFTING THE LATCH TO THE HOOK WHICH HELD IT UP LEFT THE ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HIM
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IF YOU WOULD ONLY WAIT SIR PLEADED THE AGONIZED FISHER WAIT BE HANGED SNARLED THE OTHER I'VE WAITED THREE YEARS I TELL YOU TELL MISTER KARA TO EXPECT ME WHEN HE SEES ME HE WENT OUT AND MOST UNNECESSARILY BANGED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
AND YOU WILL HURT HIM BEYOND FORGETFULNESS FEAR IS A TYRANT AND A DESPOT MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE RACK MORE POTENT THAN THE STAKE FEAR IS MANY EYED AND SEES HORRORS WHERE NORMAL VISION ONLY SEES THE RIDICULOUS
I SHALL FEEL THAT HIS TRIP WHICH HAS COST ME A LARGE SUM OF MONEY WILL NOT HAVE BEEN WASTED I AM DEAR MISTER MEREDITH YOURS VERY SINCERELY REMINGTON KARA
AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
THAT IS A WORD I NEVER USE NOR DO I LIKE TO HEAR IT EMPLOYED HE SAID BLACKMAIL SUGGESTS TO ME A VULGAR ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN MONEY
AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER
RUM COVE SAID FISHER HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT BEFORE THE CLOSED DOOR OF THE ROOM AND SMILINGLY SURVEYED THE GREAT STEEL LATCH WHICH SPANNED THE DOOR AND FITTED INTO AN IRON SOCKET SECURELY SCREWED TO THE FRAMEWORK HE LIFTED IT GINGERLY
SPECIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT SCOTLAND YARD WHITEHALL HE PUT IT CAREFULLY IN HIS POCKET AND WENT FROM THE ROOM TO CHANGE LARGE AS THE HOUSE WAS KARA DID NOT EMPLOY A REGULAR STAFF OF SERVANTS A MAID AND A VALET COMPRISED THE WHOLE OF THE INDOOR STAFF
KARA FOLDED THE LETTER AND INSERTED IT IN ITS ENVELOPE HE RANG A BELL ON HIS TABLE AND THE GIRL WHO HAD SO FILLED T X WITH A SENSE OF AWE CAME FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS IS DELIVERED MISS HOLLAND
DEFTLY HE LIFTED HIS LEFT HAND FROM THE POCKET CROOKED THE ELBOW BY SOME QUICK MANIPULATION AND THRUST THE BOOKS WHICH THE VALET MOST RELUCTANTLY HANDED TO HIM BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE HAD TAKEN THEM TELL MISTER KARA I WILL CALL AT MY OWN TIME
A MAN AGAINST WHOM MY FAVOURITE WEAPON WOULD FAIL SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH INTEREST IN HER EYES WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE WEAPON MISTER KARA SHE ASKED FEAR HE SAID
WHIP A MAN AND THE MEMORY OF IT PASSES FRIGHTEN HIM FILL HIM WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING AND APPREHENSION AND LET HIM BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO SOMEONE HE LOVES BETTER THE LATTER
MISTER GATHERCOLE SAID THE GIRL QUICKLY FISHER NODDED YES MISS I COULDN'T GET HIM TO STAY THOUGH SHE PURSED HER LIPS THOUGHTFULLY MISTER KARA WILL BE VERY CROSS BUT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN HELP IT I WISH YOU HAD CALLED ME
SIX O'CLOCK EH YOU WILL TELL MISTER KARA THAT I CALLED GIVE ME THOSE BOOKS BUT I ASSURE YOU SIR STAMMERED FISHER GIVE ME THOSE BOOKS ROARED THE OTHER
HE WAS A MAN WHO WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED ATTENTION IF ONLY FROM THE SOMEWHAT ECCENTRIC NATURE OF HIS DRESS AND HIS UNKEMPT APPEARANCE HE WAS DRESSED IN A WELL WORN OVERCOAT OF A SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED CHECK HE HAD A TOP HAT GLOSSY AND OBVIOUSLY NEW AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
IF I CAN BUY IT WELL AND GOOD IF I CAN BUY THOSE WHO CAN USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO SECURE THIS THING FOR ME SO MUCH THE BETTER IF I CAN OBTAIN IT BY ANY MERIT I POSSESS I UTILIZE THAT MERIT
IS THAT YOUR CREED SHE ASKED QUIETLY PART OF IT MISS HOLLAND HE SMILED SHE PLAYED IDLY WITH THE LETTER SHE HELD IN HER HAND BALANCING IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK HER EYES DOWNCAST
BUT HER MIND WAS VERY FAR FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE BEFORE HER SHE HEARD THE SOFT THUD OF THE FRONT DOOR CLOSING AND RISING SHE CROSSED THE ROOM RAPIDLY AND LOOKED DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW TO THE STREET SHE WATCHED FISHER UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
THIS INTERESTED HIM MIGHTILY AND HE REPLACED THE CHEQUE BOOK WITH THE TIGHTENED LIPS AND THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN WHO WAS THINKING RAPIDLY HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE SECRETARY WAS ENGAGED IN MAKING COPIES OF KARA'S CORRESPONDENCE
ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST
HE TOLD ME HE WOULD BE IN AT SIX O'CLOCK AT THE LATEST SIX O'CLOCK YE GODS STORMED THE MAN IMPATIENTLY WHAT DOG AM I THAT I SHOULD WAIT TILL SIX
THE MAID WHO WAS ALSO COOK AROSE UP AS THE GIRL ENTERED IT'S A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES TO SEE YOU IN MY KITCHEN MISS SHE SMILED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RATHER LONELY MISSUS BEALE SAID THE GIRL SYMPATHETICALLY LONELY MISS CRIED THE MAID
HE RANG THE BELL THIS TIME FOR HIS VALET FISHER HE SAID I AM EXPECTING A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN NAMED GATHERCOLE A ONE ARMED GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU MUST LOOK AFTER IF HE COMES
DETAIN HIM ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER BECAUSE HE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF AND I WANT TO SEE HIM
HE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR WITH A MEDITATIVE FROWN AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STAIRS TO THE HALL HE WAS LESS THAN HALF WAY DOWN WHEN THE ONE MAID OF KARA'S HOUSEHOLD CAME UP TO MEET HIM THERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WANTS TO SEE MISTER KARA SHE SAID HERE IS HIS CARD
AND A PAIR OF PEARL STUDS THE NEWCOMER GLARED ROUND AT THE VALET TAKE THESE HE ORDERED PEREMPTORILY POINTING TO THE BOOKS UNDER HIS ARM FISHER HASTENED TO OBEY AND NOTED WITH SOME WONDER THAT THE VISITOR DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ASSIST HIM
TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
FISHER TOOK THE CARD FROM THE SALVER AND READ MISTER GEORGE GATHERCOLE JUNIOR TRAVELLERS CLUB I'LL SEE THIS GENTLEMAN HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN BRISK INTEREST HE FOUND THE VISITOR STANDING IN THE HALL
IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED
WHAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE USE OF SUCH AN AWFUL WEAPON SHE ASKED IT IS AMPLY JUSTIFIED TO SECURE AN END HE SAID BLANDLY FOR EXAMPLE I WANT SOMETHING I CANNOT OBTAIN THAT SOMETHING THROUGH THE ORDINARY CHANNEL OR BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF ORDINARY MEANS
IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
T X HE WENT ON SOMEWHAT ORACULARLY IS A MAN FOR WHOM I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT YOU WILL PROBABLY MEET HIM AGAIN FOR HE WILL FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT MYSELF I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU
I FAIRLY GET THE CREEPS SITTING HERE HOUR AFTER HOUR IT'S THAT DOOR THAT GIVES ME THE HUMP SHE POINTED TO THE FAR END OF THE KITCHEN TO A SOILED LOOKING DOOR OF UNPAINTED WOOD THAT'S MISTER KARA'S WINE CELLAR NOBODY'S BEEN IN IT BUT HIM
AT SIX O'CLOCK MISS THE MAN REPLIED THERE IS RATHER AN IMPORTANT LETTER HERE WHICH HAS TO BE DELIVERED SHALL I RING UP FOR A MESSENGER NO I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE ADVISABLE YOU HAD BETTER TAKE IT YOURSELF
I INTEND INCREASING THAT TO FIVE POUNDS BECAUSE YOU SUIT ME MOST ADMIRABLY THANK YOU SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY BUT I AM ALREADY BEING PAID QUITE SUFFICIENT SHE LEFT HIM A LITTLE ASTONISHED AND NOT A LITTLE RUFFLED
AS YOU KNOW AND AS I HAVE GIVEN YOU PROOF I HAVE THE GREATEST ADMIRATION IN THE WORLD FOR ONE WHOSE WORK FOR HUMANITY HAS WON SUCH UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION I HOPE THAT WE SHALL BOTH FORGET THIS UNHAPPY MORNING AND THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF RENDERING TO YOU IN PERSON
THIS TIME HE MADE THE BEDROOM THE SCENE OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS THE SAFE HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TOUCH BUT THERE WAS A SMALL BUREAU IN WHICH KARA WOULD HAVE PLACED HIS PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE MORNING THIS HOWEVER YIELDED NO RESULT
HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DEPRECATING SMILE I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS WITH ANY PERSON SAID THE GIRL COLDLY I AM PAYING YOU THREE POUNDS A WEEK I THINK HE SAID
MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
HE WILL PROBABLY BE INTERESTED IF YOU TAKE HIM INTO THE LIBRARY VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE URBANE FISHER WILL YOU CHANGE BEFORE YOU GO OUT KARA SHOOK HIS HEAD I THINK I WILL GO AS I AM HE SAID GET ME MY FUR COAT THIS BEASTLY COLD KILLS ME
TO DISTURB A RELATIONSHIP WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HOPED WOULD BE MUTUALLY PLEASANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW GATHERCOLE WHO WILL BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PART HE IS PLAYING TO ACT AS PEACEMAKER BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MYSELF
AND ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT THEY ARE ALSO JUSTIFIED IT IS A MATTER OF PLANE HE SAID AIRILY VIEWED FROM MY STANDPOINT THEY ARE SORDID CRIMINALS THE SORT OF PERSON THAT T X MEETS I PRESUME IN THE COURSE OF HIS DAILY WORK
HE SHIVERED AS HE GLANCED INTO THE BLEAK STREET KEEP MY FIRE GOING PUT ALL MY PRIVATE LETTERS IN MY BEDROOM AND SEE THAT MISS HOLLAND HAS HER LUNCH FISHER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS CAR WRAPPED THE FUR RUG ABOUT HIS LEGS
IF HE EXPECTED HER TO GIVE HIM ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROCEED HE WAS DISAPPOINTED PROBABLY HE REQUIRED NO SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOCIAL INFERIORS HE WAS SOMEWHAT MONOPOLIZING CUT A MAN'S FLESH AND IT HEALS HE SAID
I KNOW HE GOES IN SOMETIMES BECAUSE I TRIED A DODGE THAT MY BROTHER WHO'S A POLICEMAN TAUGHT ME I STRETCHED A BIT OF WHITE COTTON ACROSS IT AN IT WAS BROKE THE NEXT MORNING MISTER KARA KEEPS SOME OF HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THERE SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF
CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE BESIDE THE GIRL WAS THE MIDDLE AGED DOMESTIC WHO WAS PARLOUR MAID SERVING MAID AND HOUSEKEEPER IN ONE MISS HOLLAND SAT AT HER DESK TO ALL APPEARANCE READING OVER THE LETTERS SHE HAD TYPED THAT AFTERNOON
THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
SHE HANDED HIM THE LETTER AND HE READ WITHOUT A DROOP OF EYELID THE SUPERSCRIPTION
EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
SAID THE WOMAN DOUBTFULLY I WISH HE'D BRICK IT UP THE SAME AS HE HAS THE LOWER CELLAR I GET THE HORRORS SITTIN HERE AT NIGHT EXPECTIN THE DOOR TO OPEN AN THE GHOST OF THE MAD LORD TO COME OUT HIM THAT WAS KILLED IN AFRICA MISS HOLLAND LAUGHED I WANT YOU TO GO OUT NOW SHE SAID
A PAIR OF PINCE NEZ SAT CROOKEDLY ON HIS NOSE AND TWO FAT VOLUMES UNDER HIS ARM COMPLETED THE PICTURE FISHER WHO WAS AN OBSERVER OF SOME DISCERNMENT NOTICED UNDER THE OVERCOAT A CREASED BLUE SUIT LARGE BLACK BOOTS
FISHER WENT BACK TO THE LIBRARY THE GIRL WAS SEALING UP SOME LETTERS AS HE ENTERED AND LOOKED UP I AM AFRAID MISS HOLLAND I'VE GOT MYSELF INTO VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE WHAT IS THAT FISHER ASKED THE GIRL
IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMOND
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
HENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGE
THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
BUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTY
THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
I FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROL
I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
A GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEAL
RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
THAN A GOOD MANY PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUND
WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
ROLLIN'S VOICE WAS SO LOW ON THIS LAST SENTENCE THAT RACHEL HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING HIM ABOVE THE NOISE AROUND THEM BUT SHE KNEW WHAT HE HAD SAID SHE WANTED TO ASK WHAT HIS METHODS WERE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK HIM
WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
IN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN
AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
WE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME WHERE VIRGINIA HAS MANAGED TO GET ALL HER IDEAS ABOUT THIS WORK VIRGINIA KNOWS MORE NOW ABOUT ARNOLD TOYNBEE AND EAST END LONDON AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN AMERICA
SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
BUT THE FASHIONABLE DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN AROUND TOWN THE CLUB MEN ARE LEFT OUT OF ALL PLANS FOR REACHING AND CHRISTIANIZING AND YET NO CLASS OF PEOPLE NEED IT MORE I SAID TO MYSELF I KNOW THESE MEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR BAD QUALITIES I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM
AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
