Abstract Mamo Data Handler class, main source of feeding data
for the MAMO framework.

This is the main class that will supply data to the MAMO framework.
Users that need custom Data Loaders (ex. for multitask learning),
need to create implementation of this class that suits their need.
The class consists only of abstract methods giving the users a basic
skeleton and a freedom to define custom Data Handlers and load data
from different sources. We include an implementation of this class
for developing Auto Encoder models in the 'ae_data_handler.py' script.
