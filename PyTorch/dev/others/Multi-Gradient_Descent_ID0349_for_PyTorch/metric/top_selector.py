TopSelector class, used selecting top samples.

The TopSelector class is a helper class used by different metric
implementations to select the top values from arrays. This logic is extracted
into a class of its own to increase reusability and simplify testing.
this class uses NumPy and will slowly be fazed out.

        mask on their positions.

        The method masks the k input values with the highest numerical value in
        every row of the input 2D numpy array.

        Args:
            values: A numpy array of values.
            k: An integer that denotes the number of values to obtain from the
                ranking of the values. The method masks the k values with the
                highest scores.

        Returns:
            A binary mask in the form of a numpy 2D array that outputs the
            top k values per row from the input values.
            For example:

            values = array([[0.5, 0.7, 0.3],
                                 [0.4, 0.1, 0.7]])
