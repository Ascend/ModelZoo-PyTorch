### About Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks

If you're new to CycleGAN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G:X→Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F:Y→X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X))≈X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

### Model Description

We have two networks, G (Generator) and D (Discriminator).The Generator is a network for generating images. It receives a random noise z and generates images from this noise, which is called G(z).Discriminator is a discriminant network that discriminates whether an image is real. The input is x, x is a picture, and the output is D of x is the probability that x is a real picture, and if it's 1, it's 100% real, and if it's 0, it's not real.

### Installation

#### Clone and install requirements

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Lornatang/CycleGAN-PyTorch
$ cd CycleGAN-PyTorch/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Download pretrained weights

**Abstract** <br>
Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal 
is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training 
set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be 
available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source 
domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn 
a mapping G:X→Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable
from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly
under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F:Y→X and introduce a cycle 
consistency loss to push F(G(X))≈X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented 
on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection 
style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. 
Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority
of our approach.
