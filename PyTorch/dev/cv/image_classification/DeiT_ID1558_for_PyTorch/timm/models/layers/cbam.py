""" CBAM (sort-of) Attention

Experimental impl of CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521

WARNING: Results with these attention layers have been mixed. They can significantly reduce performance on
some tasks, especially fine-grained it seems. I may end up removing this impl.
