## Validation accuracy results

Our results were obtained by running the applicable
training scripts in the [framework-container-name] NGC container
on NVIDIA DGX-1 with (8x V100 16GB) GPUs.
The specific training script that was run is documented
in the corresponding model's README.


The following table shows the validation accuracy results of the
three classification models side-by-side.


| **arch** | **AMP Top1** | **AMP Top5** | **FP32 Top1** | **FP32 Top5** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| resnet50 | 78.46 | 94.15 | 78.50 | 94.11 |
| resnext101-32x4d | 80.08 | 94.89 | 80.14 | 95.02 |

## Training performance results

### Training performance: NVIDIA DGX A100 (8x A100 40GB)


Our results were obtained by running the applicable
training scripts in the pytorch-20.06 NGC container
on NVIDIA DGX A100 with (8x A100 40GB) GPUs.
Performance numbers (in images per second)
were averaged over an entire training epoch.
The specific training script that was run is documented
in the corresponding model's README.

The following table shows the training accuracy results of the
three classification models side-by-side.


|      **arch**       | **Mixed Precision** |   **TF32**    | **Mixed Precision Speedup** |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:---------------------------:|
|      resnet50       |    9488.39 img/s    | 5322.10 img/s |            1.78x            |
|  resnext101-32x4d   |    6758.98 img/s    | 2353.25 img/s |            2.87x            |
| se-resnext101-32x4d |    4670.72 img/s    | 2011.21 img/s |            2.32x            |

ResNeXt and SE-ResNeXt use [NHWC data layout](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html) when training using Mixed Precision,
which improves the model performance. We are currently working on adding it for ResNet.
