**Hopenet** is an accurate and easy to use head pose estimation network. Models have been trained on the 300W-LP dataset and have been tested on real data with good qualitative performance.

For details about the method and quantitative results please check the CVPR Workshop [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00925).

To use please install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (for video) - I believe that's all you need apart from usual libraries such as numpy. You need a GPU to run Hopenet (for now).

To test on a video using dlib face detections (center of head will be jumpy):
```bash
python code/test_on_video_dlib.py --snapshot PATH_OF_SNAPSHOT --face_model PATH_OF_DLIB_MODEL --video PATH_OF_VIDEO --output_string STRING_TO_APPEND_TO_OUTPUT --n_frames N_OF_FRAMES_TO_PROCESS --fps FPS_OF_SOURCE_VIDEO
```
To test on a video using your own face detections (we recommend using [dockerface](https://github.com/natanielruiz/dockerface), center of head will be smoother):
```bash
python code/test_on_video_dockerface.py --snapshot PATH_OF_SNAPSHOT --video PATH_OF_VIDEO --bboxes FACE_BOUNDING_BOX_ANNOTATIONS --output_string STRING_TO_APPEND_TO_OUTPUT --n_frames N_OF_FRAMES_TO_PROCESS --fps FPS_OF_SOURCE_VIDEO
```
Face bounding box annotations should be in Dockerface format (n_frame x_min y_min x_max y_max confidence).

Pre-trained models:

[300W-LP, alpha 1]

[300W-LP, alpha 2]

[300W-LP, alpha 1, robust to image quality]

For more information on what alpha stands for please read the paper. First two models are for validating paper results, if used on real data we suggest using the last model as it is more robust to image quality and blur and gives good results on video.

Please open an issue if you have an problem.
