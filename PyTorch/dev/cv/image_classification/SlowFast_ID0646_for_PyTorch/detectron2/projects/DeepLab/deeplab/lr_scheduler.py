# NOTE: PyTorch's LR scheduler interface uses names that assume the LR changes
# only on epoch boundaries. We typically use iteration based schedules instead.
# As a result, "epoch" (e.g., as in self.last_epoch) should be understood to mean
# "iteration" instead.

# FIXME: ideally this would be achieved with a CombinedLRScheduler, separating
# MultiStepLR with WarmupLR but the current LRScheduler design doesn't allow it.
