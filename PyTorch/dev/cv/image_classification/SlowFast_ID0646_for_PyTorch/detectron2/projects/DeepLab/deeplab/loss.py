    Hard pixel mining with cross entropy loss, for semantic segmentation.

    Arguments:
        ignore_label: Integer, label to ignore.
        top_k_percent_pixels: Float, the value lies in [0.0, 1.0]. When its
            value < 1.0, only compute the loss for the top k percent pixels
            (e.g., the top 20% pixels). This is useful for hard pixel mining.
        weight: Tensor, a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
