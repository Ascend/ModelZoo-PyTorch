# MMAL-Net

note
- please download CUB_200_2011,FGVC-aircraft,Stanford_Cars in datasets from origin repo:

This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Multi-branch and Multi-scale Attention Learning for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (MMAL-Net)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09150) (Fan Zhang, Meng Li, Guisheng Zhai, Yizhao Liu), and the paper has been accepted by the 27th International Conference on Multimedia Modeling (MMM2021). Welcome to discuss with us in issues!

## Requirements
- python 3.7
- pytorch 1.3.1
- numpy 1.17.3
- scikit-image 0.16.2
- Tensorboard 1.15.0 
- TensorboardX 2.0
- tqdm 4.41.1
- imageio 2.6.1
- pillow 6.1.0

## Datasets
Download the [CUB-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200-2011/CUB_200_2011.tgz) datasets and copy the contents of the extracted **images** folder into **datasets/CUB 200-2011/images**. 

Download the [FGVC-Aircraft](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/archives/fgvc-aircraft-2013b.tar.gz) datasets and copy the contents of the extracted **data/images** folder into **datasets/FGVC_Aircraft/data/images**)

You can also try other fine-grained datasets. 

## Training TBMSL-Net
If you want to train the MMAL-Net, please download the pretrained model of [ResNet-50](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1raU0m3zA52dh5ayQc3kB-7Ddusa0lOT-) and move it to **models/pretrained** before run ``python train.py``. You may need to change the configurations in ``config.py`` if your GPU memory is not enough. The parameter ``N_list`` is ``N1, N2, N3`` in the original paper and you can adjust them according to GPU memory. During training, the log file and checkpoint file will be saved in ``model_path`` directory. 

## Evaluation
If you want to test the MMAL-Net, just run ``python test.py``. You need to specify the ``model_path`` in ``test.py`` to choose the checkpoint model for testing.

## Model
We also provide the checkpoint model trained by ourselves, you can download if from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13ANynWz7O3QK0RdL4KqASW8X_vMb6V4B) for **CUB-200-2011** or download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LD1Jz6Dh-P6Ibtl17scfrTFQTrW4Zy3/view?usp=sharing) for **FGVC-Aircraft**. If you test on our provided model, you will get 89.6% and 94.7% test accuracy, respectively.
