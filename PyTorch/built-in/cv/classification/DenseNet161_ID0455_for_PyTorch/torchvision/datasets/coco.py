class CocoCaptions(VisionDataset):
    """`MS Coco Captions <http://mscoco.org/dataset/#captions-challenge2015>`_ Dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory where images are downloaded to.
        annFile (string): Path to json annotation file.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.ToTensor``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes input sample and its target as entry
            and returns a transformed version.

    Example:

        .. code:: python

            import torchvision.datasets as dset
            import torchvision.transforms as transforms
            cap = dset.CocoCaptions(root = 'dir where images are',

            print("Image Size: ", img.size())
            print(target)

        Output: ::
