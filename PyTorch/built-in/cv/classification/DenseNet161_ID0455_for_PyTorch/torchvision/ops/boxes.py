def nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold):

    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the boxes according
    to their intersection-over-union (IoU).

    NMS iteratively removes lower scoring boxes which have an
    IoU greater than iou_threshold with another (higher scoring)
    box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4])
        boxes to perform NMS on. They
        are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
        scores for each one of the boxes
    iou_threshold : float
        discards all overlapping
        boxes with IoU < iou_threshold

    Returns
    -------

        int64 tensor with the indices
        of the elements that have been kept

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4]
        boxes where NMS will be performed. They
        are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
