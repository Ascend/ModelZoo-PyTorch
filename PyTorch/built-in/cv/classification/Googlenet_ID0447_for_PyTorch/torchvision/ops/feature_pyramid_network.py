class FeaturePyramidNetwork(nn.Module):
    """
    Module that adds a FPN from on top of a set of feature maps. This is based on
    `"Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144>`_.

    The feature maps are currently supposed to be in increasing depth
    order.

    The input to the model is expected to be an OrderedDict[Tensor], containing
    the feature maps on top of which the FPN will be added.

    Arguments:
        in_channels_list (list[int]): number of channels for each feature map that
            is passed to the module
        out_channels (int): number of channels of the FPN representation
        extra_blocks (ExtraFPNBlock or None): if provided, extra operations will
            be performed. It is expected to take the fpn features, the original
            features and the names of the original features as input, and returns
            a new list of feature maps and their corresponding names

    Examples::

        >>> m = torchvision.ops.FeaturePyramidNetwork([10, 20, 30], 5)
        >>> # get some dummy data
        >>> x = OrderedDict()
        >>> x['feat0'] = torch.rand(1, 10, 64, 64)
        >>> x['feat2'] = torch.rand(1, 20, 16, 16)
        >>> x['feat3'] = torch.rand(1, 30, 8, 8)
        >>> # compute the FPN on top of x
        >>> output = m(x)
        >>> print([(k, v.shape) for k, v in output.items()])
        >>> # returns
        >>>   [('feat0', torch.Size([1, 5, 64, 64])),
        >>>    ('feat2', torch.Size([1, 5, 16, 16])),
        >>>    ('feat3', torch.Size([1, 5, 8, 8]))]
