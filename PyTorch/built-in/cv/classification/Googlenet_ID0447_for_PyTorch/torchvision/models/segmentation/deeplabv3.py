    Implements DeepLabV3 model from
    `"Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587>`_.

    Arguments:
        backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
            The backbone should return an OrderedDict[Tensor], with the key being
            "out" for the last feature map used, and "aux" if an auxiliary classifier
            is used.
        classifier (nn.Module): module that takes the "out" element returned from
            the backbone and returns a dense prediction.
        aux_classifier (nn.Module, optional): auxiliary classifier used during training
