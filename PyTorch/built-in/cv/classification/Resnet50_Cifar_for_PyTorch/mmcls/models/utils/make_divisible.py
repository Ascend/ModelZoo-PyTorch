    This function rounds the channel number down to the nearest value that can
    be divisible by the divisor.

    Args:
        value (int): The original channel number.
        divisor (int): The divisor to fully divide the channel number.
        min_value (int, optional): The minimum value of the output channel.
            Default: None, means that the minimum value equal to the divisor.
        min_ratio (float): The minimum ratio of the rounded channel
            number to the original channel number. Default: 0.9.
    Returns:
        int: The modified output channel number
